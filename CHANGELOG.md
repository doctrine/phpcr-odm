Changelog
=========

* **2013-09-27**: Cleaned up LocaleChooserInterface:
  - renamed getPreferredLocalesOrder to getFallbackLocales as this was not
    containing the primary language for a while now.
  - fixed getDefaultLocalesOrder to include the default locale again.
* **2013-09-27**: Removed deprecated custom events in favor of
  - Doctrine\Common\Persistence\Event\LoadClassMetadataEventArgs
  - Doctrine\Common\Persistence\Event\ManagerEventArgs
  - Doctrine\Common\Persistence\Event\LifecycleEventArgs

  Only the MoveEventArgs are specific to PHPCR-ODM.

* **2013-09-27**: Removed deprecated legacy handling for the mapping that
  allowed using "name" instead of "property" to configure PHCPR property in mapping.

1.0.0-RC1
---------

* **2013-09-26**: [Model] add HierarchyInterface for objects that resolve to
  nt:HierarchyNode, the method AbstractFile::addChild is
  changed to use the interface instead of AbstractFile as parameter.


1.0.0-beta5
-----------

* **2013-09-13**: [QueryBuilder] Replaced query builder with new
  implementation. See documentation:
  http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-phpcr-odm/en/latest/reference/query-builder.html
* **2013-08-16**: [Model] removed Doctrine\ODM\PHPCR\Document\Image and moved
  it to the CmfMediaBundle. Note that the CmfMediaBundle image is itself a file
  and no longer uses a file child.
* **2013-08-05**: [#314] properly validate nullable=false on flushing
  If you see exceptions about fields not being nullable, either adjust your
  mappings to say nullable=true or fix your code so they are not null.

1.0.0-beta4
-----------

* **2013-08-04**: [#304] fix various bugs around translation fallback
  Fixed translation loading to never return non-nullable
  fields set to null but fallback to the next. Also attribute translation will
  properly fall back again if a translation is not present.

* **2013-08-04**: [#305] Unset previously computed document change set if there are no changes
  fields set to null but fallback to the next. Also attribute translation will
  properly fall back again if a translation is not present.

1.0.0-beta3
-----------

* **2013-07-26**: [#301 & #299 & #296] use the referring property name and not the class field name
  This and a couple other PR fixed that we now use the configured PHPCR name
  when fetching referrers and defining references and not the document field
  name.

* **2013-07-23**: [#298] remove non-lifecycle-callbacks from schema, validate lifecyclce callbacks
  Cleanup and validation of lifecycle callbacks.

* **2013-07-02**: [#294] inherit document level options and allow mapped-superclass to have all options

* **2013-06-06**: [#291] fixed move by assignment

* **2013-05-27**: [#288] Event refactoring to use doctrine commons 2.4 events where possible
 * Use the doctrine common event argument classes where possible instead of
   custom classes. The classes `Doctrine\ODM\PHPCR\Event\LifecycleEventArgs`
   and `Doctrine\ODM\PHPCR\Event\ManagerEventArgs` and
   `Doctrine\ODM\PHPCR\Event\LoadClassMetadataEventArgs` are deprecated and
   will be deleted soon. Switch your code to depend on the classes in namespace
   `Doctrine\Common\Persistence\Event\` instead.
 * The only PHPCR-ODM specific event argument that will remain is MoveEventArgs
   because it has additional parameters and the move operation is PHPCR-ODM
   specific.

* **2013-05-13**: [#279] Cleanup mapping names
 * The option to overwrite what PHPCR property a value is stored in
   (analogue to the ORM "column") is now called "property" instead of
   "name" for all mapping drivers. For Child mappings, the annotation
   and yml fields are now called "nodeName" instead of "name", for XML
   it is the node-name attribute.
   The XML and yml mappings now use "name" instead of "fieldName" to
   identify the property of the model class they are mapping.
 * For the XML mappings, mixins are now collected inside a <mixins>
   element and the attribute specifying the mxin type name is renamed
   from "name" to "type". The document primary type attribute is fixed
   from "nodeType" to "node-type" and parentdocument became
   parent-document.

* **2013-03-06**: [#252] Split Referrers mapping into MixedReferrers and Referrers.
 * The MixedReferrers has the semantics of what was until now Referrers, but
   does not have the `filter` attribute anymore. A read only view of all kinds
   of documents that reference this document.
 * Referrers now requires the `referringDocument` that identifies the Document
   class that refers to this Document, and `referencedBy` to name the referring
   field of the Document. Referrers now supports the cascading options, just
   like ReferenceMany.
 * For mixed situations, there is still DocumentManager::getReferrers() to get
   all documents for a certain reference property name.

* **2013-01-18**: Removed DocumentRepository->getDocumentsByQuery as it is no longer needed.
   createQuery returns you an ODM query that can find documents directly.
 * To get documents from a PHPCR query there is DocumentManager->getDocumentsByPhpcrQuery()

* **2013-01-13**: Introduced ODM QueryBuilder and refactored PHPCR QueryBuilder
 * DocumentManager->getQueryBuilder now returns an ODM QueryBuilder and
   NOT the PHPCR QueryBuilder. The PHPCR QueryBuilder is still available via.
   DocumentManager->getPhpcrQueryBuilder().
 * The results of ->execute() on the new ODM query are Documents by default.
   It is possible to obtain the PHPCR nodes by using ->getPhpcrNodeResult() or
   ->execute(Query::HYDRATE_PHPCR);
 * CreateQuery($statement, $language) has NOT been implemented in the new query builder.
   It is, however, still available in the DocumentManager.
 * DocumentManager->getDocumentsByQuery renamed to getDocumentsByPhpcrQuery()
